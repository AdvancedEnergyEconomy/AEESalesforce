# AEESalesforce
Apex code for AEE Salesforce instance

Note that the Salesforce naming conventions must be followed. For example, a trigger `MyTrigger.trg` must have a corresponding test class called `TestMyTrigger.cls`. This is required so that when you are running test suite, Salesforce's code coverage check will not fail.
